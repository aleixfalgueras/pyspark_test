#################### saveAsTable ####################

In the case the table already exists, behavior of this function depends on the save mode, specified by the mode function
(default to throwing an exception).

append: Append contents of this DataFrame to existing data, it will use the format and options of the existing table.
overwrite: Overwrite existing data (the schema does not need to be the same as that of the existing table)
error or errorifexists: Throw an exception if data already exists.
ignore: Silently ignore this operation if data already exists.

saveAsTable uses the internal DataFrame to access the SparkSession that is used to access the SessionState and in the end the SessionCatalog
to check whether the table exists or not.

! The overwrite save mode works over all the partitions even when dynamic is configured, use insertInto instead

! You might get an unintuitive exception sometimes:
"The format of the existing table x is `HiveFileFormat`. It doesn't match the specified format `ParquetFileFormat`.;"
Possible cases:
- use "append" mode in the first insert
- use more than one param in the function
